/**
 * The heuristic function considers five factors that may affect the result:
 * 1. the total number of marbles for each player in every state; more marbles, more possibility to win
 * 2. if the marbles are more closer to center; this factor may be more important in early game which is a strategy to divide opponent's marbles to parts and more possible to push out opponent
 * 3. penalize closer to edge because marbles near edge are more vulnerable
 *
 * the heuristic function considers not only the state is good or not for the current player, but also for the opponent, which gives a relative evaluation to help maximize the current player's advantage and minimize the opponent's
 * the weights for each factor is changing based on the stage of the game. In early game, center control is more important; in late game the piece count is more important.
