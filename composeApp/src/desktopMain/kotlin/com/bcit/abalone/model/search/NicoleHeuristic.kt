/**
 * Nicole's heuristic implementation.
 *
 * This heuristic finds the distances that the players' marbles are from the center of the board.
 * The closer the current player's marbles are to the center, the higher their score, and vice versa
 * for the opposing player. The second part is that if there are more of the player's pieces than
 * the opposition's pieces on the board, that will increase the score, and vice versa again.
 * The final value is the player's score minus the opposition's score.
